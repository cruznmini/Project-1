### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because services running can be limited, system installation and update can be streamlined and processes become more replicable. 

The playbook implements the following tasks:

 Install s docker.io, pip3, and the docker module
  # Use apt module
    - name: Install docker.io
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        name: docker.io
        state: present

  # Use apt module
    - name: Install pip3
      apt:
        force_apt_get: yes
        name: python3-pip
        state: present

  # Use pip module
    - name: Install Docker python module
      pip:
        name: docker
        state: present

Increase the virtual memory 
# Use command module
    - name: Increase virtual memory
      command: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

 Uses sysctl module 
  # Use sysctl module
    - name: Use more memory
      sysctl:
        name: vm.max_map_count
        value: "262144"
        state: present
        reload: yes

Downloads and launches the docker container for ELK server 

# Use docker_container module
    - name: download and launch a docker elk container
      docker_container:
        name: elk
        image: sebp/elk:761
        state: started
        restart_policy: always
        published_ports:
          - 5601:5601
          - 9200:9200
          - 5044:5044



The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.



### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
Web 1 - 10.0.0.5
Web 2 - 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Filebeat
Metric Beat





These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
Filebeat is a log data shipper for local files. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log directories or specific log files, tails the files, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing. An examle of such are the logs produced from the MySQL database supporting our application.
Metricbeat collects metrics and statistics on the system. An example of such is cpu usage, which can be used to monitor the system health.



### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the configuration file from your Ansible container to your Web VMâ€™s.
- Update the /etc/ansible/hosts file to include the IP address of the Elk Server VM and web servers.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://[Elk_VM_Public_IP]:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

Which file is the playbook? The Filebeat-configuration 
Where do you copy it? copy /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml to /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? 
How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? 
update filebeat-config.yml -- specify which machine to install by updating the host files with ip addresses of web/elk servers and selecting which group to run on in ansible
Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
 http://[your.ELK-VM.External.IP]:5601/app/kibana
